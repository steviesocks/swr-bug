## SWR bug
Simple React app with NextJs and SWR to test a bug across browsers. 
Look for console.logs showing that SWR refetch on focus works in Safari but not in Chrome.
This may have to do with `document.visibilityState`


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
